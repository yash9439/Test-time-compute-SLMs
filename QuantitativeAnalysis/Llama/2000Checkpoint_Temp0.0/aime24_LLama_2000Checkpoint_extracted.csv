\frac{7}{2},"$\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$. Since there are 8 triangles, the total area of the octagon is $8 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} = 2\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the octagon is $2\sqrt{2}$. </reasoning> <answer>2\sqrt{2} </answer>"
-1,"- a_1},$ so we can substitute this into the equation above: \[(a_9)^9 = \left(\frac{1}{1 - a_1}\right)^9 = \left(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1}}\right)^9 = \left(\frac{1}{\frac{1 - 1}{1}}\right)^9 = \left(\frac{1}{0}\right)^9 = 1^9 = 1.\] The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
106^\circ,"that $\angle AHD = 90^\circ$ and $\angle EHB = 90^\circ$. Therefore, we can find $\angle AHB$ as $180 - 90 - 74 = 26^\circ$. Therefore, the measure of $\angle AHB$ is $26^\circ$. </reasoning> <answer>26 </answer>"
