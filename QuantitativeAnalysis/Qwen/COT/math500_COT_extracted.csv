"\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)","\((0, 3)\) lies on the positive y-axis, the angle \( \theta \) is: \[ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \] Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are: \[ (r, \theta) = \left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \]"
p - q,"+ \frac{1}{q} \ \right) \] 8. **Final Expression**: Therefore, the final expression for the double sum in terms of \( p \) and \( q \) is: \[ \boxed{\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} \right)} \]"
\frac{14}{3},"+ f(0) = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} \] Add the fractions: \[ \frac{6}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \frac{14}{3} \] Thus, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{\frac{14}{3}} \]"
9,"+ 1) \] - For our case with \( n = 2^2 \times 7^2 \): \[ d(196) = (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \times 3 = 9 \] Therefore, the number 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors."
\text{Evelyn},"\text{ units per unit time} \] Comparing these values, we see that Carla has the highest average speed at approximately 3.467 units per unit time. Therefore, the student with the greatest average speed is **Carla**."
42,"to the hexagon, and each side is 7 inches long, the total perimeter of the hexagon is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) inches. So, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches."
27,"perfect cube. Thus, the correct smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is actually \(2187\), not \(729\). My previous explanation was incorrect; the correct answer is \(2187\)."
90^\circ,"We use the fact that \(\arccos(x) = \tan^{-1}(x/\sqrt{1-x^2})\): \[ \theta_{degrees} = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\frac{33}{\sqrt{247}}}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{33}{\sqrt{247}}\right)^2}} \right) \] After simplifying this expression: \[ \theta_{degrees} \approx 50^\circ \] Therefore, the angle between the two lines is approximately **50Â°**."
3\sqrt{13},"= \sqrt{117} = \sqrt{9 \times 13} = \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{13} = 3\sqrt{13} \] So, the distance between the points \((2, -6)\) and \((-4, 3)\) is \(3\sqrt{13}\). Expressing this in simplest radical form: \[ \boxed{3\sqrt{13}} \]"
4,"unique values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses. Therefore, the number of different values that can be obtained is: \[ \boxed{3} \]"
2220,"making it divisible by 10 but not necessarily by 3. We need to ensure our number is divisible by both 3 and 10.

\frac{3}{56},"p(8) \): \[ p(8) = \frac{8}{(8-1)(8+1)} \] Simplify the denominator: \[ p(8) = \frac{8}{7 \cdot 9} \] \[ p(8) = \frac{8}{63} \] \[ p(8) = \frac{8}{63} \] Thus, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{\frac{8}{63}} \]"
284,"its only divisors are 1 and itself (79). Therefore, the proper divisors of 79 are just 1. Finally, for step 4, we sum the proper divisors of 79. \[1\] Therefore, the final answer is 1."
5,"sides by \( 9\pi \): \[ \frac{45\pi}{9\pi} = h \] This simplifies to: \[ h = \frac{45}{9} \] So, the height \( h \) of the cylinder is: \[ h = \frac{45}{9} \text{ cm} \]"
