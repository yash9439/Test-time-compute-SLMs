0,P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b) = P(a)P(b)P(c)P(-a/b)
\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -14 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix},"-\frac{26}{5} - \frac{3}{7} - \frac{50}{7} = -\frac{208}{35} - \frac{15}{35} - \frac{250}{35} = -\frac{208+15+250}{35} = -\frac{473}{35} \] The other components follow similarly. So, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -\frac{473}{35} \\ -\frac{19}{7} \\ -10 \end{pmatrix}} \]"
"\left( \frac{3}{2}, -13 \right)","- 3\), we identify the slope \(m\) and the y-intercept \(b\). The slope \(m\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\), and the y-intercept \(b\) is \(-3\). Thus, the ordered pair \((m, b)\) is: \[ \boxed{\left( \frac{3}{2}, -3 \right)} \]"
28,"calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each topping together: \[ 8 \times 7 = 56 \] Therefore, Mikka can order 56 different pizzas with two different toppings from his selection of 8 toppings."
1,"180\), but they do not exist within the range. Thus, no such numbers exist. Therefore, the number of integers between \(1\) and \(100\) that are divisible by \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\) is: \[ \boxed{0} \]"
16,"= 45 \] So, \( A = 4 \) and \( B = 5 \). Thus, \( A + B = 4 + 5 = 9 \). Therefore, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{9} \]"
10,"dark squares, effectively dividing the rectangle into two equal halves. Thus, the area of the shaded region is: \[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ unit}^2 \] So the final answer is: \[ \boxed{1} \]"
5,"4. **Substitute this back in**: \[ 5 - 5^3 + 5^3 \] 5. **Combine like terms**: \[ 5 - 5^3 + 5^3 = 5 - 0 = 5 \] Therefore, the final answer is \(5\)."
56,"56 = 24 \] Verify the score: \[ 5 \times 56 + (-2) \times 24 = 280 - 48 = 232 \] Thus, Frank answered 56 questions correctly. The final answer is: \[ \boxed{56} \]"
2,"grows exponentially, \(\frac{1}{F_{n+2}}\) approaches zero as \(n\) goes to infinity. Therefore, the limit is zero, and we have: \[ \frac{1}{F_1} = \frac{1}{F_1} = 1. \] Thus, the value of the sum is: \[ \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}. \]"
110,- 75 - 75 + 15 \] \[ 360 = 195 + P + Ch - 15 - 75 - 75 + 15 \] \[ 360 = 195 + P + Ch - 15 -
2,"1\): \[x^3 - 2x + 1 = (2x + 1) - 2x + 1 = 2x + 1 - 2x + 1 = 2.\] Therefore, the value of \(x^3 - 2x + 1\) is \(\boxed{2}\)."
6,"4. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:** - Since one Trinket = 4 Blinkets, then: \[ \text{Number of Trinkets for 24 Blinkets} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ Trinkets} \] Therefore, 56 Drinkets are equivalent to 6 Trinkets."
"11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","Consider the number 1000000000... (with as many zeros as needed). \[ 1000000000... \div 450 = 200000000... \] This is still not an integer, so we need more than just zeros.

"(-1,6)","plug these values into the midpoint formula: \[ M_x = \frac{-5 + 3}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \] \[ M_y = \frac{5 + 7}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 1 \] So the midpoint is \((-1, 1)\)."
\frac{1}{2},"to the total number of possible outcomes. Since all 12 outcomes are favorable, the probability is: \[ \frac{12}{12} = 1 \] Thus, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square is \(\boxed{1}\)."
\frac{16}{27},"- \frac{4}{27} = \frac{6}{27} - \frac{4}{27} = \frac{2}{27} \) gallons. Thus, the amount of milk in the bucket when Sam gets home is \( \frac{2}{27} \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is \( \boxed{\frac{2}{27}} \)."

x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1,"x + 1 \) and the remainder is \( 2 \). Therefore, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1} \]"
14,"the \(3u\) terms: \[ (u^2 - u^2) + (3u - 3u) + (-4 + 18) = 0 + 0 + 14 = 14. \] Thus, the simplified form of the expression is: \[ \boxed{14}. \]"
550,"\text{ gallons} - 41.67 \text{ gallons} = 358.33 \text{ gallons} \] Therefore, if Karla had driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car instead of an SUV, she would have saved approximately **358.33 gallons** of gasoline last year."
256,"\[ f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(16) = 2^{16} = 64 \] Now, we need to find the square root of this result: \[ \sqrt{f(f(f(f(1))))) = \sqrt{64} = 8 \] Thus, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{8} \]"
45,"- 9 = 81 \] Add 9 to both sides: \[ 2x = 90 \] Divide both sides by 2: \[ x = 45 \] Thus, the integer value of \( x \) is \(\boxed{45}\)."
\frac{1}{2},"the rectangle into two equal areas, the probability is: \[ \frac{1}{2} \] Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\)."
15,+ 12x^2(b + y)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 + 2)^2 + 12x^2(b + y)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 + 2)^2 + 12x^2(b + y)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 + 2)^2 + 12x^2(b + y)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 + 2)^2 + 12x^2(b +
8,"\frac{12384590062991}{24769180125984} \neq \frac{255}{512} \] Finally, let's try \( n = 52 \): \[ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{52} = \frac{1}{24769180125984} \] Then: \[ 1 - \frac{1}{24769180125984} = \frac{24769180125983}{24769180125984} \] \[ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{24769180125983}{24769180125984} = \frac{24769180125983}{49538360251968} \neq \frac{25"
9,"k = 1 \), the number of girls is 13 and the number of boys is 2. This satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the number of boys at the meeting is: \[ \boxed{2} \]"
44,"Thus, the correct value is: \[ 17 \times 12 = 28 \] \[ 28 \div 83 = 3 \text{ remainder } 28 \] \[ 28 \equiv 28 \pmod{83} \] Thus, the correct value is: \["
47,"9(5) + 2(1) - (5)(1) + 5\] Now, perform the multiplications: \[= 45 + 2 - 5 + 5\] Finally, add the numbers together: \[= 47\] So, the value of \(5 \star 1\) is \(47\)."
64,"= 35 + 100 = 135\] The two smallest positive integer solutions are 35 and 135. The average of these two numbers is: \[\frac{35 + 135}{2} = \frac{170}{2} = 85\] Therefore, the answer is: \[\boxed{85}\]"
\frac{639}{40},"Further simplifying this fraction: \[ x = \frac{3215 \div 5}{200 \div 5} = \frac{643}{40} \] Therefore, the distance between the buildings on the map is approximately 16.075 inches, or more precisely, it is \(\frac{643}{40}\) inches."
143,"+ a = 10(7) + 3 = 73 \). The sum of the original number and the reversed number is: \[ 307 + 73 = 380 \] Thus, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{380} \]"
10,"\[ \text{Representatives from 8th Grade} = 18 \times \frac{65}{117} \] 5. Perform the multiplication: \[ 18 \times \frac{65}{117} = \frac{18 \times 65}{117} = \frac{1170}{117} = 10 \] So, the 8th grade should have **10** representatives."
y = 2x + 3,"x' \] Thus, the image of the line \( y = 2x + 1 \) under the transformation \(\mathbf{M}\) is: \[ y = x \] Therefore, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{y = x} \]"
6,"\times 2 \times 1 \times 1} \] \[ C(6, 5) = \frac{6}{1} \] \[ C(6, 5) = 6 \] So there are 6 different ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students."
"-2,1","\] So, \(x = -14\) is not a root. Since none of the above tests yield zero, there are no integer roots for the given polynomial. Thus, the answer is: \[ \boxed{\text{No integer roots}} \]"
0,"follows: \[ 54 - (6 \times 9) = 54 - 54 = 0 \] So, the remainder is 0. Therefore, the remainder of \( 54 \mod 6 \) is \( 0 \). \[ \boxed{0} \]"
41,"answer, we should choose the smallest number among these options, which as it represents the minimum number of students. Therefore, the number of students who showed up to the archery class this week is **31**."
\$18.90,"inches. - Cost per unit area = \(\frac{1.30}{6} = 0.2167\) dollars per square inch. - Total cost = \(27 \times 0.2167 = 5.8349\) dollars. Therefore, the cost of a 3-inch cube would be approximately \$5.83."
75^\circ,"\(T\) should balance out), then: \[ 70^\circ + \angle STR = 180^\circ \] Solving for \(\angle STR\): \[ \angle STR = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ \] Therefore, the measure of \(\angle STR\) is \(\boxed{110}\)."
12,"= 4. \] Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations: \[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8. \] Therefore, the final answer is: \[ \boxed{8}. \]"
59,final answer is that there is no money left after converting all the coins into dollar bills because the total amount in cents exactly matches the total amount of money they had before the sale.
